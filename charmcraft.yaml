description: |
  Charm that requests X.509 certificates using the `tls-certificates` interface.

  It uses the user-provided `subject` configuration to generate a certificate signing request
  (CSR) that will be inserted into its unit relation data. In return, a certificate provider
  should use this CSR, generate a certificate, and provide it back into their application
  relation data.

  This charm is useful when developing and testing certificate provider.
